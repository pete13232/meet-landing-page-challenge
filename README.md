## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to structure layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox not just for individual components, but for entire page layouts. As the structure became more complex, I realized the importance of writing clear and precise layout code to keep it maintainable and scalable in the future.
